# Pokemon-Showdown-Winning-vs-Losing-Team-Patterns
### Data visualization of patterns between the Winning and Losing team across 10,000 Gen 9 OU Pokemon Showdown matches.
# How does it work?
### The battle info is collected by locally storing the json associated with each battle on the Gen 9 OU Pokemon Showdown Replay page. Then the data is cleaned based on different criteria, so that only relevant info is extracted from each json and converted to text files. Data in these text files are compared to each other across several different metrics and are graphed for better visualization.
